Key Insights

- Top 10 % of orders greater than $800 deliver around 45% of revenue.

- Nov‑Dec sales jump 35 % vs yearly average -> plan inventory & staffing, create more incentives to buy in slow seasons, seasonal inventory and promo calendars should concentrate on those gaps

- Women spend more in Apparel/Beauty, men in Electronics/Sports Gear -> market products accordingly to each gender to capture greater market

- Saturday revenue ≈ 1.4 times revenue on Tuesday -> mid‑week flash sales could smooth demand and increase sales, Tuesdays are the slowest making them prime for flash discounts

- The customer age curve peaks around 35, buyers under 25 contribute the fewest dollars -> indicating an opportunity for entry‑level SKUs and products ot target the underserved market
